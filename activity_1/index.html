        <h2><ins>not all forest fires are bad</ins></h2>
            <p>
                Periodic small fires that are controlled help speed up the process of 
                decomposition and creates open patches for new plants to grow, 
                improve habitat and food for animals and deliver nutrients to the plants that survive. 
                Controlled burning involves setting planned fires to maintain the health of a forest. 
                A planned fire gets rid of dead grass, fallen tree branches, and thick undergrowth.
